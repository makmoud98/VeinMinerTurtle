some lua code for a mining 'turtle' in the ComputerCraft minecraft mod http://www.computercraft.info
i would deploy mutiple bots running mine.lua that waited for a command from listen.lua

mine.lua:

implemented a recursive function that was used to mine a vein of ore. 

it used coal that it mined to refuel itself while also returning to a chest to deposit ores.

listen for a command from the main bot after completing its run
